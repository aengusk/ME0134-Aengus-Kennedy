best coefficients: 
Kp_left = 0.003
Ki_left = 0.01
Kd_left = 0

Kd seems only to make things worse. 

some Ki testing
with Ki = 0.01, measure distance traveled when target is 100 mm/s and duration is 10 s
96cm, 96cm, 96.5cm
with Ki = 0.015, measure distance traveled when target is 100 mm/s and duration is 10 s
97.5cm, 97.5cm 
with Ki = 0.02
98cm
with Ki = 0.03
99cm but oscillated

98With Kp = 0.0035: Ki = 0.02
98cm but oscillated
